# Before to use

You need push notification keys, and put them on env.local.
Run in your terminal `cd back_api_rest` and then `npm run web-push generate-vapid-keys` then put the output keys on the env.local file.

# How to Use

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed on your machine. Simply download the installer from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and go through the installation steps.

Once Node.js is installed, open your command prompt or terminal and **navigate into this project folder**. There, run `npm install` to install all required dependencies.

Finally, run `npm start` to start the development server and visit [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to see the running application.
